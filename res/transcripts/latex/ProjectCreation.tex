Once you created your GitHub account and you are log on the website, 
the first thing to do is to create a new project.
\\\\
On Github a project is called a repository so for each course you have to 
create a repository.
\\\\
Enter your project and an optional description. 
Note you can check "Initialize with README" to get a blank document in your project.
\\\\
Finally you get a project and you are ready to take notes.
