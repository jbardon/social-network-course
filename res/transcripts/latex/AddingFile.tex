To add a new file, it's very simple. For example, let's take this text. And then we add a new file here. We will called it \emph{Differences.md}. Then we will put the text on it. And we will valid it by creating a new version of the project. Then we can see that the new file is here. And now we will take its URL and we will add it as a link to the \emph{README}. We are using the link' syntax of Markdown, as you have learned before. And as you can see it's very simple. Then we valid the changes. And we are all done.
