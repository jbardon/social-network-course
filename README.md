December 2012, a peaceful elementary school in Newtown (USA, Connecticut) got involved in a tragedy.  
A mass shooting resulting in twenty children and six adults dead. Sad story.  

But reactions were not at all the same. Of course most people were affected, we are human after all. But some others took the time to create some online disruptions. Especially on Facebook and Twitter, by creating fake accounts on Adam Lanza, the murderer. Social networks can be very rude.

### Goal of this paper

But let's face it... that's sadly how the world works. So there is good and bad everywhere. And so are social networks. The aim of this small paper is not to list all advantages and disadvantages, but to have a quick overview of why social networks are a simple and tiny virtual representation of our society.  

And if we are afraid of social networks, then it's an indirect way to feel
afraid of ourselves.

## We are social network

Like it said in RRRrrr!!!, a French movie :

> We are a tribe! You are a tribe! I am a tribe!. -- RRRrrrr!!!

Basically, it's a way to say we are all a network (a “tribe”), even if we are alone. People are connected with invisible strings. And that's how we work since we began to conquer the world. And ironically, it's also how it will end. Finally... We are a social network. You are a social network. I am a social network. 
  
Internet and the Web 2.0 hadn't invented it. I'm pretty sure Vercingétorix did have a vast social network and no Twitter account or Internet access.

## Some differences

## Conclusion

So this is why online social networks are only a virtual reality of our society. Social networks are not new, they are just different than they used to be. Like everything. Except the McDonald's Happy Meal of course.

And please don't forget... __We are a tribe !__
