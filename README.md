## Introduction

December 2012, a peaceful elementary school in Newtown (USA, Connecticut) got involved in a tragedy.  
A mass shooting resulting in twenty children and six adults dead. Sad story. But reactions were not at all the same. Of course most people were affected, we are human after all. But some others took the time to create some online disruptions. Especially on Facebook and Twitter, by creating fake accounts on Adam Lanza, the murderer. Social networks can be very rude.

### Goal of this paper

But let's face it... that's sadly how the world works. So there is good and bad everywhere. And so are social networks. The aim of this small paper is not to list all advantages and disadvantages, but to have a quick overview of why social networks are a simple and tiny virtual representation of our society. And if we are afraid of social networks, then it's an indirect way to feel
afraid of ourselves.

## We are social network

Like it said in RRRrrr!!!, a Frensh movie :

> We are a tribe! You are a tribe! I am a tribe!. -- RRRrrrr!!!

Basically, it's a way to say we are all a network (a “tribe”), even if we are alone. People are connected with invisible strings. And that's how we work since we began to conquer the world. And ironically, it's also how it will end. Finally... We are a social network. You are a social network. I am a social network. Internet and the Web 2.0 hadn't invented it. I'm pretty sure Vercingétorix did have a vast social network and no Twitter account or Internet access.

## Some differences

Online social networks seem different from real ones because it's a brand new way to manage them. And it's kind of exciting, because we are no longer limited in space and time. Everything is instantaneous on the Web and crosses the planet in a fraction of a second. People see two main problems behind the “no limitations” : we tend to share a lot more and to change how we communicate. I agree with the first problem, which is well explained in the article “ How much is too much share on social media”. To sum up very quickly, some people feel way too comfortable and share things they wouldn't even openly share in front of real people. But I disagree on the second problem that says we change how we communicate. Yes it changes, it's true. But it changes because our society is changing. Society is based on communication, we are society, we are a social network. That's all. But it doesn't stop people from interacting directly together, and most of the time it came from online social networks. For instance, we manage parties through social networks. Or when a disaster occurred, people often use social network to set up a physical meeting to show their support, like with the Charlie Hebdo attack.
